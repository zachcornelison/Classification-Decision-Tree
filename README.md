# Classification-Decision-Tree
A practice notebook to work on implementing a Decision Tree algorithm using Python. In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. This classification algorithm will be used with medical data to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Using the built algorithm, classify the unknown results of a new patient and visualize the results
